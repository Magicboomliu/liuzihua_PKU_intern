# liuzihua_PKU_intern
 internship in PKU in machine Preception lab

## DAY One : Try some fancy
##### (1) VAE
##### (2) autoencoder to reduce noise
##### (3)Word2Vec
##### (4) Style Variance
## DAY Two : learning knowledge on K-means and EM Algorithm
##### (1) DCGAN face generaterations
##### (2)Predict the stocks
##### (3)K-means
##### (4) object_detections(google's API)
## DAY Three : Use the dlib(a C++ module) to finish following cv tasks:
##### (1) Face detection
##### (2) Face key points detection
##### (3) Face recon
##### (4) Object blocks tracking
####  Plus:read the papar above on image caption by HKU 2018 ICCCV
## DAY Four : User the paper read on day 4 and other reference to code a image caption project
##### image caption using encoder-decoder(LSTM with attendtion based)
## DAY Five : make it clear for LSTM & Seq2Seq and attention-based model in SMT and apply it on Tensorflow .
#### (1) Neural Network Machine Translation(a Seq2Seq work)
#### (2) Neural Network Machine Translation(a Seq2Seq work using attention based model)
## DAY Six : review the concept of WGAN, CGAN， use instances to code the WGAN and the CGAN，also lean something about ACGAN， write the intern daily of first week.
